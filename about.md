My name is Ben and I grew up in and around Orlando, Florida. I've been a nerd of one kind or another my entire life. Whether that be an A/V geek in middle and high school, a gadget fanatic in college, or a generalist tech obsessive now in my 30s, technology of all kinds has been a passion for as long as I can remember. I've been a professional developer for almost a decade, but I was coding long before then. Even though I've worked with C# and .NET, Java (ugh Swing), and lots of things in between, my favorite platform so far has been the iPhone, no contest. I've loved my time with Objective-C, and I'm even more excited by Swift, especially since it's now a viable language for production work.

In a completely unexpected turn, I became a teacher 4 years ago. I taught Mobile Engineering at The Iron Yard from the beginning of 2015 to the end of 2017. It was by far the best and most challenging job I've ever had the pleasure to attempt.

Since my time at TIY, I've worked to continue to build environments for junior developers and people aspiring to be to flourish. I run the local iOS Developer Meetup ([@iOSOrlando on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/iosorlando)) and regularly give talks on topics from beginner level to advanced.

I also recently started a tech education podcast with an old colleague and friend, Brian Gates called [Model View Conversation](https://www.mvc.fm). Be sure to check out our website and subscribe to the podcast if you are trying to break into tech and need some help getting started. Or if you just want to learn more about the industry and maybe advance to the next level.
