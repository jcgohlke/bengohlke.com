See below for my new tutorial series on getting started with iOS development. Iâ€™ll start off by covering the basics of the two primary languages used in building iOS apps: Objective-C and Swift.

The following tutorial series provide the same examples and concepts, but present them from the perspective of the respective language being covered. So I recommend going through one series and then the other rather than jumping around. Each lesson in the series builds on the previous one.
